# Chapter 7 - Working with Complications

If the release of the Apple Watch does not go down in history for revolutionizing the field of wearable computing, at the very least it will go down in history for inspiring countless bloggers to pretend that theyâ€™ve always known what a watch complication was.

In this chapter, we will bring you up (or down) to the level of the bloggers by explaining what a complication is, why your users might want you to add one to your app, and how you might go about doing so.

## Projects

This repository contains two projects:

1. *I Said What?* - This project is our main example and takes you through creating a complication from scratch in a fresh project.
2. *Simple Life* - This project is a supplementary example that shows how to add complication support to an existing watchOS app.


## Corrections

If you find a mistake in the sample code, please feel free to raise it as an [Issue against this repository](https://github.com/bwa-book/chapter-07/issues).
